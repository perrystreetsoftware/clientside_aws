# Installation

This example assumes you have a dockerized clientside_aws container already running. If you do not, after you have installed clientside_aws locally on OSX and built its image, run

    clientside_aws_run

This will launch a container running on the correct port for this example to work. Then, simply run:

    ruby test.rb

And you should see this example run successfully.
